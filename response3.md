# Reading Response 3

## Summary

The first article we read by Marc Scott was called "Please stop sending me your shitty Word documents".  In this article, Scott shares his own problems with Microsoft Word.  He shares that he does not have Microsoft Word, and he hates that when most people send Word documents, they just assume he has the Microsoft package.  Because he uses other programs to make documents, many of the special artistic devices that Word uses, such as word art, tables gifs, or borders, do not show up on his computer.  The second article we read was called "Why Microsoft Word must Die" by Charlie Stross.  This article again rips Microsoft Word for taking away the author's creative abilities by forcing them into certain formats.  He gives a little more history of Word, telling of how Word was broken from the start because Steve Jobs and Bill Gates because they tried to keep two different formatting types.  He then tells of how over the years, Microsoft bought out any companies that invented new software, partially halting innovation.  He ends by saying that the worst part about Word is that it is unavoidable, and he, as a writer, feels forced by publishers to use Word.  The next article was called "Markdown: Markup that's Downright Simple" by Erik Martin.  Martin claims that there is a movement to go back to more simplistic tools, and this movement is putting Markdown on the rise.  Dr. Evia makes an appearance, telling how Markdown helps bridge the gap between simple text and HTML or XML.  Evia makes it cleat that Markdown is not to be used for design, just for simple text and content.
